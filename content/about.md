# about me

I'm Kadin DeMarche. I'm in high school and I'm learning to code, mostly by breaking things and googling error messages at 2am.

## what I'm up to

Right now I'm:
- Applying to colleges (the essays never feel long enough, hence this blog)
- Building web apps and learning from the ones that fail (which is most of them)
- Writing here so future me can look back and cringe
- SPL of my Scout troop (Senior Patrol Leader, basically means I'm supposed to be organized but I'm really not)
- On the mountain bike team (when I'm not procrastinating)
- Taking AP Physics (fun but super hard, actually rewarding to learn though)
- Taking French (honors class, also super hard, but in a different way)
- A hard procrastinator (this explains a lot)

I've won some orienteering competitions through Scouts, which is cool. But I still can't navigate city streets without Google Maps. The irony is not lost on me.

## projects

**MarkSite** - Static site generator for GitHub Pages. No Ruby, no Go. Built it because Jekyll annoyed me and I was avoiding French homework. [GitHub](https://github.com/Kadin-Demarche/marksite)

**Slate** (dead) - Tried to build a free alternative to LinkedIn without paywalls. Learned a lot about infrastructure costs and why "free" platforms usually aren't. Cost me $120 in hosting before I realized I couldn't afford it. Wrote about it [here](/blog/why-i-left-linkedin-and-started-blogging/).

**CampusLink** - Job search thing for college students. Still working on it. Trying not to make the same mistakes I made with Slate.

## why this exists

College apps give you 350 words per essay. Not enough space to explain projects, failures, or anything actually interesting. How do you explain being SPL of a Scout troop, winning orienteering competitions, being on the mountain bike team, taking AP Physics and French, all while being a hard procrastinator who somehow still gets things done? You can't. Not in 350 words.

This blog is for stuff that doesn't fit in application forms. If you're from college admissions, thanks for reading past the forms. I appreciate it.
