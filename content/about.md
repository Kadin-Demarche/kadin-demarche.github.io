# About Me

I'm Kadin DeMarche. I'm in high school and I'm learning to code.

## What I'm Up To

Right now:
- Applying to colleges (the essays never feel long enough)
- Building web apps and learning from the ones that fail
- Writing here so future me can look back and cringe

## Projects

**MarkSite** - Static site generator for GitHub Pages. No Ruby, no Go. Built it because I wanted something simple. [GitHub](https://github.com/Kadin-Demarche/marksite)

**Slate** (dead) - Tried to build a free alternative to LinkedIn without paywalls. Learned a lot about infrastructure costs and why "free" platforms usually aren't. Wrote about it [here](/blog/why-i-left-linkedin-and-started-blogging/).

**CampusLink** - Job search thing for college students. Still working on it.

## Why This Exists

College apps give you 350 words per essay. Not enough space to explain projects, failures, or anything actually interesting.

This blog is for stuff that doesn't fit in application forms. If you're from college admissions, thanks for reading past the forms.
