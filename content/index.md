# hey, I'm kadin

I'm in high school. I build things with code when I'm not procrastinating on AP Physics homework or avoiding French class. Sometimes I start projects that are way too ambitious for my budget (looking at you, Slate).

I write about tech, failed projects, and trying to figure out what comes next. No LinkedIn self-promotion, no meaningless posts. Just honest writing about building stuff and learning from expensive mistakes.

## what I'm doing

Right now I'm juggling a lot. I'm SPL of my Scout troop (which means I'm supposed to be organized but I'm really not), on the mountain bike team, taking AP Physics (fun but super hard) and French (also hard, but in a different way), and applying to colleges. Oh, and I'm a hard procrastinator, so most of my coding happens at 2am when I should be sleeping.

I've won some orienteering competitions through Scouts, which is cool, but I still can't navigate city streets without Google Maps. The irony is not lost on me.

## recent posts

Check out my [blog](/blog) to see what I'm working on. Or what I'm avoiding working on. Depends on the day.
