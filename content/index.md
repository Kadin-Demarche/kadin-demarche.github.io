# Hey, I'm Kadin

I'm in high school. I build things with code, learn in public, and sometimes start projects that are way too ambitious for my budget.

I write about tech, failed projects, and trying to figure out what comes next. No LinkedIn self-promotion, no meaningless posts. Just honest writing about building stuff and learning from mistakes.

## Recent Posts

Check out my [blog](/blog) to see what I'm working on.

## About Me

I build web apps and try to solve problems I see. Sometimes they work. Sometimes I learn expensive lessons about AWS bills.

Right now: Applying to colleges and writing about it.
